# Semantic-Segmentation

This repository contains Python code for a semantic segmentation model using TensorFlow. The semantic segmentation model is a deep learning model that can be used to segment images into different classes. The model uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to learn the features of the image and then uses a decoder network to generate a segmentation map for each pixel of the input image.
